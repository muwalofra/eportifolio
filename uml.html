										<h1>Unified Modelling Language</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>The Unified Modelling Language (UML) is a general-purpose visual modelling language that is used to specify, visualize, construct and document artifacts of a software system. Thought this module, we looked at various that include use case Diagrams, activity diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, state machine diagrams, component diagrams and deployment diagrams.</p>
									<p>The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used to develop and maintain software systems. It has various stages that include requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance.</p>
									<p>Various UML diagrams are best applicable to various stages in SDLC as discussed below.</p>
									<p> 1.	Requirements Analysis is stage where the requirements of the software system are gathered and analyzed. This includes identifying the needs of the end-users, stakeholders, and the business as a whole. The output of this stage is a requirements specification document. The UML diagram that best fit this role include;<br>•	Use Case Diagram is used to represent the functionalities that the system provides. Use case diagrams help to identify the actors of the system, their interactions with the system, and the system's response to those interactions. This defines what happens at requirements analysis stage.<br>•	Activity Diagrams is used to represent the flow of activities in the system. Activity diagrams help to define the sequence of activities required to achieve a specific goal. This also represents well what happens at the requirements analysis phase</p>
									<p> 2.  Design is a stage where the software system is designed. This includes creating a high-level architecture for the system, designing the user interface, and defining the algorithms and data structures required to implement the system. The output of this stage is a design specification document. The UML diagrams that best suit this stage include;<br>•	Class Diagram is used to represent the classes and their relationships in the system. Class diagrams help to define the attributes, operations, and relationships between classes. This is typical a design function.<br> •	Sequence Diagram is used to represent the interactions between objects in a particular use case. Sequence diagrams help to define the sequence of messages exchanged between objects. This is done at a design phase.<br>•	State Diagram is used to represent the different states of an object and the transitions between those states. State diagrams help to define the behavior of an object in response to different events. This is important at the design phase as well.</p>
									<p> 3.  Implementation is a stage in SDLC where the software system is developed. This includes writing code, testing, and debugging the system. The output of this stage is a working software system. The UML diagrams suitable for this stage include;<br>•	Component Diagrams are used to represent the components and their dependencies in the system. Component diagrams help to define the physical architecture of the system. <br> •	Deployment Diagrams are used to represent the physical deployment of the components in the system. Deployment diagrams help to define the hardware and software environment required for the system. This is suitable at the implementation stage.</p>

										<h1>Module Reflections</h1>
									</header>
									<p>UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a graphical language used in software engineering to create visual models of software systems. It was created in the 1990s and has since become a standard notation for software modeling.</p>
									<p>UML provides a set of symbols and diagrams for representing different aspects of software systems, including classes, objects, components, and interactions between them. Some of the commonly used UML diagrams include use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, state machine diagrams, activity diagrams, and component diagrams.</p>
									<p>UML is useful for documenting, analyzing, and designing software systems, and it can help developers and stakeholders communicate and understand the structure and behavior of a system. It is a flexible and adaptable language that can be used for a wide range of software development projects, from small applications to complex enterprise systems.</p>
									<p>This module has been very helpful to me in that it has introduced various UML tools that will assist me in my software development journey beyond the program. The UML tools have easy to understand processed that guides us in all the stages of software development and in the process document the process for future referencing.</p>
									<p>Overall, UML is an essential tool for software engineers and developers, and its use can help ensure that software systems are designed and developed in a clear, organized, and efficient manner.</p>
